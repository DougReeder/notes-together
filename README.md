Notes Together
==============

Free your mind from mundane details! Toss in text, pictures, links and files Shared from native apps. Be confident you can find any note on any device. Take control of your data with remoteStorage. Never spend time tidying up â€” unless you want to!

A web app for taking notes (or copied snippets of text or pictures) and recalling them by context:
any words in them, or the date.
It applies the same styles to typed and pasted text, so your notes look professional.
It really shines when you have hundreds or thousands of notes.

Data is synced with other devices using the [remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io) protocol, so you control where your data is stored.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
